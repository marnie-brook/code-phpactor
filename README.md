# code-phpactor

Code phpactor is a plugin to serve as a communication medium between VSCode and [phpactor](https://phpactor.github.io/phpactor/).

Currently not all functionality is supported, however it will be added as and when I am available to do so with the intention of completely supporting the api.

Current features:
    - Jump to Definition
    - Autocomplete/intellisense
    - Copy class
    - Move class
    - New Class
    - Import Class
